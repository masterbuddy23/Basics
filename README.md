#  Turtle in PythonðŸ’»
### This repository is for Beginners who are trying to get hands on turtle development in python.
## Background

turtle is a pre-installed Python library that enables users to create pictures and shapes by providing them with a virtual canvas.
The onscreen pen that you use for drawing is called the turtle and this is what gives the library its name.

## Build and Install

Instructions about how to build a python program using turtle
found in the [Turtle documentation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/turtle-programming-python/).

## Example

A simple program using turtle, but still:

```
# Python program to draw square
# using Turtle Programming
import turtle
skk = turtle.Turtle()
 
for i in range(4):
    skk.forward(50)
    skk.right(90)
     
turtle.done()
```

## Documentation

The Turtle documentation is hosted at [Read the docs](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/turtle-programming-python/).
